## Course Structure
The structure of the course is centred around three 3-week blocks, where you will engage with one experiment per block. The experiments are done with a lab partner, but all of your submitted materials will be your own work. The sophistication-level of your approaches to each experiment will build throughout the term as you incorporate the short mini-lessons from the start of each lab into your experimental methods, analysis approaches and communication output. Weekly communication tasks provide opportunities to apply what was learned from the mini-lessons and to receive feedback from the teaching team, where these small assignments are designed to gradually build up your skills across various aspects of scientific written and graphical communication. The final product at the end of the course will be a complete paper written on one of your experiments.

## Learning Outcomes
The primary goal of this course is to develop your scientific reasoning skills and the communication of that reasoning through written and graphical communication. 
We will build on your existing experimental and data analysis skills, continue to develop your skills related to maintaining an effective laboratory notebook, and build up your ability to produce the essential parts of a typical scintific paper: abstract, introduction, methods, conclusion, effective figures, diagrams and captions.

## Learning Activities
The course is built upon two interconnected types of activity. We will have a weekly synchronous lab session, where you will work on an experiment with a partner and support from the teaching team. The second main activity, which you will be responsible for outside of lab sessions, is the set of weekly communication tasks. These will be connected dircetly to your current or most-recently completed experiment, and will gradually build essential graphical and writing skills, culminating in a final paper. Each weekly lab session will begin with a mini-lesson focusing on the main in-lab and out-of-lab tasks for the week. 

## Learning Materials
Course materials will be provided primarily via Canvas, with Python-specific content being available via a github repository (linked from Canvas). These will include slides related to data analysis, working with python, graphical techniques, and notes on our communication tasks. Laboratory notes, as well as your analysis, will be done electronically in Jupyter notebooks.

## Assessments of Learning
Assessments of your work will be made primarily on the written materials that you submit. These involve three components: 
* Your electronic notebooks, which includes weekly assessment of the quality of your notes, your data, and your data analysis. Additionally, we will perform semi-frequent in-class notebook assessments, where we will assess the current state of your lab notebook and ask relevant follow-up questions.
* Weekly communication tasks
* A final paper with a format similar to a typical scientific publication, built up from the weekly communication assignments, and with an editing cycle where you submit a draft and receive feedback before final submission at the end of term. Additionally, we will schedule you for a brief oral quiz to follow-up on your first draft of your final paper. 

Detailed rubrics for all of these components will be available within the each communication task's submission assignments. The overall grade scheme is:

* 40%: Laboratory notes   
* 30%: Communication assignments    
* 30%: Final paper  

Because feedback on each communication task is typically important for your next lab session, we need to emphasize things being submitted on time. This will provide the TAs with sufficient time to grade/provide feedback and return the submitted tasks in advance of your next lab session. A 10% penalty will be applied to all late submissions and the deadline for late submissions is one week after the original due date.

If you ever have any concerns related to a graded submission, please contact the grading TA first. If you feel that the issue has not been resolved to your satisfaction by discussing it with the grading TA, please reach out to Joss.

## Academic Integrity Policies
We expect that all of your submitted work represents something where you have made *significant intellectual contributions* and where that work ultimately reflects your understanding of the material. Below we outline how these policies apply to specific aspects of the course. It is always better to check with us if you are unsure about your level of intellectual contribution rather than to later find yourself engaged in academic misconduct procedures.


**Collaborative work:** We expect you to work collaboratively with a partner from the perspective of planning your experimental approaches, collecting your data and planning your data analysis. However, we want each of you to take full responsibility for producing your own written work, executing your own analysis and producing your own graphical communication. As was the case in Physics 119, this can be summed up as "share ideas, not content". You are always welcome to discuss your approaches with your partner, to confirm results and to learn from your partner's approaches. At no point should your work be copied, paraphrased or modified from that of your partner.

**Generative AI:** You are welcome to use ChatGPT and other generative AI to help support your writing and coding in this class. However, we are trying to develop *your* skills in this course so it is very important that you hold yourself to a high standard when it comes to making *significant intellectual contributions*. Asking ChatGPT to improve the grammar of a paragraph that you have written is a great way to make use of this type of resource, and ChatGPT is endlessly helpful when trying to make formatting changes to graphs. Please keep in mind the course's goal of developing your scientific reasoning skills and communicating that reasoning through writing. If your use of generative AI feels like it is circumventing this aspect of the course, this is where the use of generative AI will be at odds with the course's academic integrity policies.

**Scientific integrity:** You should never invent or alter data as this something that completely undermines experimental science. Additionally, you should not take any aspect of work done by other students from this course (past or present) and present it as your own.


## University Policies
UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.

Details of the policies and how to access support are available on the [UBC Senate website](https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success).
