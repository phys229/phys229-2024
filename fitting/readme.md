This folder contains some modified versions of functions and notebooks you may have seen in PHYS 219
* `least_squares_fitting.ipynb` shows how to load and use the functions in `least_squared_fit.py`, which are the 1- and 2-parameter linear fits based on the analytic solution for minimizing chi-squared
* `nonlinear_fit.ipynb` is a somewhat messy notebook showing how to do a variety of things in the context of a nonlinear fit
